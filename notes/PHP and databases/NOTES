Working with databases (NOTE: localhost to get to overview)
    1. design a database (represent the real world things)
        - gather data/information - ENTITY (object or thing u want to represent)
                                  - TABLES (retrieval,classes)
    2. choose a database server / accounts (place to store data) ex. SQL, Microsoft excess(?)
    3. write SQL scripts to set up databaase (tables) (DBMS)
        - security considerations here. 
        - our focus: writing programs that interact wiht user and database (the connecting layer)
    4. choose programming language -- driver: interface or API that allows multiple languages to interact 
        PDO - reccomended version; not a database but rather an abstract and connecting layer. 

        MySQLi - older OB version of PDO

        MySQL - old, only work wiht MySQL. Deprecated from PHP; no legacies
            bad: written poorly can give unauthorized access (she shows examples)
-> more information on course site. 
    5. write considerations 
        - connection
        - execute
        - close connection
